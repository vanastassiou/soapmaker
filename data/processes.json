    "description": "Cold process (CP) soapmaking combines oils with lye solution at relatively low temperatures (typically 38-54°C). The saponification reaction generates its own heat but doesn't require external heating.\n\nThis method preserves heat-sensitive compounds in oils and allows for creative designs like swirls and layers. The trade-off is a required 4-6 week cure time before use.",
